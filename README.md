# California Real Estate
Due to an interest in real estate in general, the theme of the dataset that I will be using will centred around that. I have chosen the Real Estate Californa dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yellowj4acket/real-estate-california) as it is the most comprehensive dataset that encompasses the multiple factors that can be taken into consideration when looking at the price. Also, it will be interesting to know if there are any interdependencies between the considerations or factors.
For this project, I am assuming the role of a data analyst who has been tasked by the ehomes Team to analyse real estate prices in California.
